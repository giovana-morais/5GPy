# 5GPy

The code for 5GPy is being refactored for a better organization.

The available code in this repository is a completely functional version of 5GPy simulating graph and ILP algorithms for optimization in a 5G fog computing-based network for tests purposes.

Please, when using 5GPy in your paper, thesis or dissertation, cite the following reference:
